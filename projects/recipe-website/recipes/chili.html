            <h2>Desciption:</h2>
        <p>When a winter chill hits the air, there is nothing more cozy, comforting, and warming than a big pot of chili simmering on the stove (plus, it also makes your kitchen smell amazing at the same time!). While there are an endless variety of chili recipes to choose from, I always come back to the classic beef and bean chili. This tried-and-true recipe is flavored with onion, garlic, tomatoes, and warm spices and even better, it cooks in just an hour.</p>

                    <h4>Recipe Steps:</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Saute Aromatics.</strong> Cook the onion, stirring occasionally, until it’s tender and translucent, then add the garlic and cook just until fragrant.</li>
                    <li><strong>Mix in tomato paste.</strong> Stir to coat the onions with tomato paste, then cook until it’s a deep brick red.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cook ground beef.</strong> Add 2 pounds of ground beef and cook, breaking up the meat with a wooden spoon, until browned and cooked through.</li>
                    <li><strong>Add spices.</strong> Add a mix of chili powder, cumin, unsweetened cocoa powder, dried oregano, paprika, and cayenne pepper. Stir to coat the meat and cook until fragrant. </li>
                    <li><strong>Add beans, crushed tomatoes, and broth.</strong> Once the beans and liquids are added, bring the mixture to a boil.</li>
                    <li><strong>Simmer.</strong> Reduce the heat and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the liquid is reduced and the mixture is slightly thickened.</li>
                    <li><strong>Stir in vinegar.</strong> Remove the pot from the heat and mix in a spoonful of apple cider vinegar.</li>
                    <li><strong>Add toppings and serve.</strong> Perhaps the best part about chili is adding the toppings. Choose your favorites, pile them on top of the bowl, dig in, and enjoy.</li>
